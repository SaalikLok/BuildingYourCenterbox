### Build your Centerbox 

Get a fresh piece of paper and pick out the activities that bring you back to yourself. 

As you add items to your Centerbox, think of adding items to a toolbox. 

You want to make sure that the tools you add are easy to pull out and use.

### Make your Centerbox Better

Share your Centerbox with friends and family. See what they think. 

Even better, do this workshop again with someone else. 

Collaborate with one another as you craft it.

### Keep your Centerbox in sight

The best way to use your Centerbox, is to make sure to keep it in a place where you can see it often. 

Take a picture of it, keep it on your desk, stash it in your planner or journal.
