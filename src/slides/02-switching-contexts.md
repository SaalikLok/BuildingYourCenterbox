You're a busy human with lots of inputs, and sometimes you don't feel like yourself.

That's usually a symptom of **context switching**.

### From Computer Science
Switching contexts is a concept that comes from computer science, that describes the cost that a computer incurrs when it switches from handling one process to another.

### We're not computers, though...
As humans, we're not adapted to switch contexts. Traditionally, we've focused on one thing at a time. But that's changed with living in the digital age.

### What are times you switch context?
These could be **big life transitions**

*e.g. moving, getting a new job*

or **small switches**

*taking your attention from your work to social media*
